The adult demographic is increasingly conscious of maintaining a balanced diet and preventing chronic diseases, leading to a surge in demand for foods that address these health concerns. Products like low-calorie meals, diabetic-friendly snacks, gluten-free options, and high-protein items are becoming more accessible to adult consumers. As a result, the adult food for special dietary uses market is expected to grow at a robust pace in the coming years.</p><p>For the child segment, the Asia–Pacific market also sees significant growth, particularly in food products tailored for infants, toddlers, and children with specific nutritional needs. These products range from baby formula to snacks and meals designed to support growth and development.
